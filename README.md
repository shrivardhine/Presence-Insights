employee attendance
I recently designed a Power BI dashboard to analyze employee attendance trends .Here's what I worked on:
üìä Visualizations Used:
KPI Cards:
Displayed key metrics:
Presence %: 91.83%
Work From Home %: 10.00%
Sick Leave %: 1.10%
Line Charts:
Presence % by Date: Tracked daily attendance trends, identifying fluctuations and patterns over time.
Work From Home % by Date: Visualized work-from-home trends, highlighting peaks and troughs in remote working preferences.
Sick Leave % by Date: Analyzed sick leave trends, including spikes on specific days or periods.
Day of the Week Analysis:
A breakdown of attendance, work-from-home, and sick leave percentages for each weekday, providing insights into the most and least active days.
Data Table:
A detailed view of individual employee attendance, their work preferences, and leave statuses.
üîç Key Insights Uncovered:
Attendance Trends:
The majority of employees (91.83%) were present during the observation period, with stable trends across weeks.
Work Preferences:
Fridays had the highest work-from-home percentage (13.01%), indicating a preference for remote work towards the end of the week.
Sick Leave Patterns:
Identified minor spikes in sick leave around mid-weeks, with Mondays showing a slightly higher percentage of sick leaves (1.62%).
Daily Presence Stability:
Presence percentages remained consistent across most weekdays, with slight dips on Fridays.
I'm excited to explore more advanced visualizations and continue improving my storytelling through data!
